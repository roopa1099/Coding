Notes:

1. Design pattern are the best practices and provides a solution to recurring problems.

2. 3 types of design patterns:
    a. Creational design pattern: Deals with object creation and instantiation.
    b. Structural design pattern: Deals with relationship between classes.
    c. Behavioural design pattern: Deals with communication between classes.

3. JEE design catalog contains 4 layers: 
    a. Data access layer
    b. Service/business logic layer
    c. Presentation layer.
    d. Integration layer.

4. Singleton Class: Only one instance of object is created EG=> Logger

5. Steps for singleton:
    a. Make constructor optional.
    b. Make private static instance.
    c. Make static method to return constructor object.
    d. Take care of serialization.
    e. Serialization: ..................................
    f. Ensure objects are not cloneable as it will create another instance.
    g. Reflection Class problem => You can access the constructors and can create new instance. Solution is using Enum class.

6. Eager Initialization, Lazy initialization: Eager initialization is when the object is instantiated in the very first time whuile declaration.
                                              Lazy initialization is when it is initialized only when required.
                                        
7. Factory Pattern: Hides object creation process.

8. Factory class is responsible for returning type of object. The method will be static.

9. Abstract Factory: Factory of factories, decides which factory to be choosed/created.

10. Template Pattern:  Parent provides a template for the child classes.

11. Adapter Pattern: Used to communicate between two classes. 
    Adapter class is responsible for conversion of data required to communicate between both classes.
