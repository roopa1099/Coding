## Questions

1. What are design patterns?
Ans. - Solution to common repeating problems like repetitive code, redundant functions and logic etc..
     - Help maintain good coding practice.

2. What are the types of design patterns in Java?
Ans. - Creational DP - Deals with object creation, hiding logic about object creation, object constrcution is decoupled from  implementataion of system.(Factory design pattern, Builder design, Prototype design, Singleton design, Abstract Factory design.)
     - Structural DP - Defines how structure of classes and object should be. Defines interface and composition of classes and objects to form larger structure.(Adapter pattern, Facade Pattern, Decorator Pattern, Proxy Pattern).
     - Behavioural DP - Deals with communication of one object with another. Like Iterator Pattern, Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern.

3. What is Inversion of Control?
Ans. Helps in decoupling the dependency between layers and components in a system.

8. What are some instances where we prefer abstract classes over interfaces in Java?
Ans. Interfaces - Multiple interfaces can be implemented
                - Due to this class can have multiple behaviour
     Abstract Class - Faster
                    - No need to oveeride all methods

9.  What is Decorator Design Pattern?
