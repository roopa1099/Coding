/**
 * \
 * 
 * There is an excitation matrix A of the size NxM where A[i][j] signifies the
 * excitation level of the node present in
 * ith row and j th column.All the excitation energy values in the matrix are
 * non-negative.Swiggy Mascot has to travel from the left most node in the first
 * row to right most node in the last row using the least energy
 * possible.From a node on the matrix, Mascot is allowed to move in only four
 * directions and in each move Mascot
 * can take only one step i.e go one step vertically,horizontally, to the right
 * or to the left. The energy required
 * for a move from one node to its adjacent node is the modulus difference
 * between the excitation energies of the
 * nodes i.e if X, Y are the excitation energies of the two adjacent nodes then
 * energy required for this step is
 * [X-YI.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 1 < (N * M) <= 10^5
 * 
 * 1 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9
 * 
 * Output Format:
 * 
 * Output will be a single non-negative
 * 
 * value.
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * 
 * 2 2
 * 
 * 1 5
 * 
 * 4 10
 * 
 * Sample Output:
 * 
 * 5
